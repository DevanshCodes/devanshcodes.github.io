# Personal Website

Hi! I'm Devansh Agarwal, a Web-Developer with keen sense of Design. This is the Portfolio Website created using GatsbyJS.

## Credits

This website is the Gatsby version of the [bchiang7.github.io](https://github.com/bchiang7/bchiang7.github.io). Kudos to [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7/) for such an amazing design!

I converted the existing Jekyll Template to Gatsby for ease in maintaining as I find it easier to use React Components.

>If you're forking or cloning this Gatsby version of BrittanyChiang's work for your own portfolio, please do mention properly and link it back to this repo. Thanks!


## Getting Started

Being a Gatsby build, its very easy to set it up! After forking/cloning the repository, just `cd` to the work directory and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
